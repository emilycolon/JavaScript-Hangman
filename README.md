# GA WDI Project 1

I chose to create a Hangman game for my first project and I started out very basic. I created the three needed files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) and then wireframed out how I wanted the site to look. I then entered the basic html to create the "skeleton" of the site. From there I progressed to adding in JavaScript and jQuery in order to create the game logic. While working on the logic, I would periodically make updates to the html and add in CSS as I went. However, I primarily stayed away from adjusting the styling until I have a completed MVP.

## Instructions:

The first player will pick a word that the second player will try to guess letter by letter. Every wrong
letter guessed will result in a "piece" of the hanged man added to the gallows. Try to guess the
word before he swings!
When picking a word you can only choose a single word that does not include punctuation. You will win
the game if the guesser is unable to guess the word before the man is hanged.
When guessing, your goal is to try to guess the word one letter at a time. Wrong guesses will result
in more of the hanged man added to the gallows. Correct guesses will reveal more of the submitted
word. Don't worry, you won't be penalized if you choose the same letter more than once! You will
win the game if you are able to guess the word before the man is hanged or time runs out.

## Accomplishments:

I was excited to be able to include the instructions for the game as a pop-up modal on the page. I was also proud that I was able to incorporate a countdown timer that affects the outcome of the game (player loses if time runs out). The last thing I was most proud of is incorporating responsiveness in my CSS and my JavaScript codes.

## Unsolved Problems:

A few issues were encountered when attempting to apply certain bootstrap features (for example, the input boxes are not responding to the bootstrap class names).
