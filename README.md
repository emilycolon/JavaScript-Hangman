# GA WDI Project 1

### By: Emily Col√≥n

## Description of Project

I chose to create a Hangman game for my first project and I started out very basic. I created the three needed files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) and then wireframed out how I wanted the site to look. I then entered the basic html to create the "skeleton" of the site. From there I progressed to adding in jQuery in order to create the game logic. While working on the logic, I would periodically make updates to the html and add in CSS as I went. However, I primarily stayed away from adjusting the styling until I have a completed MVP.

## Instructions

The first player will enter a word which the second player will attempt to guess, letter by letter. The starting screen allows the first player to select a theme for the game and enter in their chosen word. Once clicking the submit button, the page changes to show blank spaces for each letter in the chosen word. The second player is given an input field to choose the letter that they are guessing. All guessed letters appear in the "Guessed Letters" section and correctly guessed letters appear in their corresponding blank space. If the word is guessed correctly, the image will change to reflect that they've won and a new modal will pop up confirming their success. If the player loses either from too many incorrect guesses or because the timer hits 0:00, the image will change to reflect their loss along with a failure modal.

## Code Style

Prettier

## Built With

HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap

## Accomplishments:

I was excited to be able to include the instructions for the game as a pop-up modal on the page. I was also proud that I was able to incorporate a countdown timer that affects the outcome of the game (player loses if time runs out). The last thing I was most proud of is incorporating responsiveness in my CSS and my JavaScript codes.

## Unsolved Problems:

A few issues were encountered when attempting to apply certain bootstrap features (for example, the input boxes are not responding to the bootstrap class names).
