                Two is unable to guess the word before the man is hanged.</h4>
            <h4>Player Two: Try to guess the word one letter at a time. Wrong guesses will result in more of the hanged man to
                be added to the gallows. Correct guesses will reveal more of the submitted word. Don't worry, you won't be
                penalized if you choose the same letter more than once! You will win the game if you are able to guess the
                word before the man is hanged.</h4>
