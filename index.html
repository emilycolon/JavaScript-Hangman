            <p>Get ready to play some Hangman! Player One will pick a word that Player Two will try to guess letter by letter.
                Every wrong letter guessed will result in a "piece" of the hanged man to be added to the gallows. Try to
                guess the word before he swings!
            </p>
            <p>Player One: Enter a word in the text box and click the Submit button.</p>
            <p>Remember: You can only choose a single word that does not include punctuation. You will win the game if Player
                Two is unable to guess the word before the man is hanged.</p>
            <p>Player Two: Enter a letter into the text box and click the submit button in order to try to guess the word.</p>
            <p>Remember: You can only guess one letter at a time. Wrong guesses will result in more of the hanged man to be
                added to the gallows. Correct guesses will reveal more of the submitted word. Don't worry, you won't be penalized
                if you choose the same letter more than once! You will win the game if you are able to guess the word before
                the man is hanged.</p>
