        <p class="instructions">Player One will pick a word that Player Two will try to guess letter by letter. Every wrong letter guessed will result
            in a "piece" of the hanged man added to the gallows. Try to guess the word before he swings!
        </p>
        <p class="instructions">Player One: You can only choose a single word that does not include punctuation. You will win the game if Player
            Two is unable to guess the word before the man is hanged.</p>
        <p class="instructions">Player Two: Try to guess the word one letter at a time. Wrong guesses will result in more of the hanged man added
            to the gallows. Correct guesses will reveal more of the submitted word. Don't worry, you won't be penalized if
            you choose the same letter more than once! You will win the game if you are able to guess the word before the
            man is hanged.</p>
